#Temperature controls how random the AI's output is.
#	Close to 0 means it always produces the most likely word.
#		Usually short and boring responses, easily getting stuck in loops.
#	1 makes it as "statistically unpredictable" as real text.
#		The AI isn't perfect at predicting humans, so results in very random behavior
#	Lots of folk wisdom is being spread about the best choice.
#		Claims that somewhere between 0.1-0.3 or even lower is optimal for coomers.
#			Ok coomers.

#Repetitiveness Penalty
#controls how repetitive the AIs output is allowed to be. 
#  <1 encourages repeats (no one wants this). 
#  1 is no penalty/off
#  > 1 penalizes repeats
#  e.g. 1.2 is a 20% penalty
#  common value is 1.2 as it's the default from the CTRL paper who introduced this https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.05858
rep-pen = 1.2

#The number of words the AI has to choose from.
# 	It always chooses the "top k" most likely next words before randomly picking one according to temperature.
#	  Low values reduce the randomness of the AI similar to temp.
#	  Wont change generation speed. 0 is off
#   Many projects turn this off and use top-p. Original AI Dungeon used 40.

#  similar to top k but probobly better. Can be used together, or you can use this instead.
#  0.9 is used as a default in a wide range of projects and papers
#	 Low values reduce the randomness of the AI similar to temp.
